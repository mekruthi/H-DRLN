# H-DRLN + Expert skill learner
__This is in development stage__

The H-DRLN (Hierarchical Deep RL Network) is a novel architecture to incorporate options (skills) within the DQN.
For further explanation see the [website](http://chentessler.wixsite.com/hdrlnminecraft).

### Expert Skill Learner
This project follows on the work we did in the [paper ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07255). In our previous work, we showed how enabling the agent to plan using skills, allows for faster learning and gives the ability to learn more complex tasks. In this work, we address a critical point from our previous work - how do you learn such skills? via _IMITATION_.

### Graphic view of created skill clusters
We use the work done by [Zahavy et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02658) and adapt the [interface they created](https://github.com/bentzinir/graying_the_box) in order to graphically view the clusters on the tSNE plot.
